texas.txt process 


I tried to save it under my Mac HD and it resulted in the error message: 

Unable to save /correspondence.csv
Error: Permission denied

I resolved it by saving it into my downloads instead. 
I also uploaded it to my repository on Github. 
  
  New key and ideas terms that I grappled with were: 
  Network analysis 
  corpus 
  
  Openrefine overview 
  
Two areas in which the program didn't work out completely

I uploaded the sublime text file to Openrefine, with the 'sender, receiever, date' as the top column. However, these three aspects were not divided up into their own columns as it wad described in the instructions. I still located the text facet button, but the suggested clusters were not similar to the described results. This resulted in a data table that wasn't necessarily wrong I dont think, but it certainly wasn't the intended goal.

I followed the video tutorial and I can definitively say that the format of the first cell (sender, receiever, date were not seperated into different cells) was the reason for the failure. This led to some misguided collection of data that resulted into different clusters being formed. 

The next issue I faced was the confusion in the save file that Openrefine offered me. I clicked EXPORT and I clicked LOCAL FILE. It was saved successfully but it is in a folder with multiple different save files within in with unfamilar names that are unable to open. There are no error messages; a window opens and then closes immediately. 

UPDATE 
I tried it again, and this time found a button beneath the intitial EXPORT button directing me towards Excel. I saved it to excel. It is in a horrible format. but it is saved and I can look at it. W.
