texas.txt process 


I tried to save it under my Mac HD and it resulted in the error message: 

Unable to save /correspondence.csv
Error: Permission denied

I resolved it by saving it into my downloads instead. 
I also uploaded it to my repository on Github. 
  
  New key and ideas terms that I grappled with were: 
  Network analysis 
  corpus
