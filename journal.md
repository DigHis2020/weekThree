Journal for week three 

This week I dealt a lot with cleaning up data for proper analysis. In this process, I had to make seemingly small decisions about my data that would end up impacting my overall results. 
In general, I was successful in including all relevant information and only removing irrelevant data in both Sublime Text and OpenRefine. 

Digital historians have a valuable advantage over regular historians in regards to the methods that can be used to analyze information. The difference between the two lies in the technology that is used to gather and discern information. Regular historians largely rely on documents in archives, and in some cases oral histories etc. to represent their knowledge. Showing work as a regular history mainly boils down to presenting specficic evidence as it was explored in the archives. 

Digital historians are able to use tools that refine data to present evidence through a digital interface. An example of this is found in the Soft/Hard History blog entries by James Baker. He uses census data and art publishing data to create a cohesive abstraction of art in the 18th and 19th centuries. As intricate and accurate as this process is, this is difficult to represent complex data science within the confined of a published article while being succinct and only including absolutely relevant details. 

There is definitely scholarly value in showing my work. In a historical study, it allows me to detail the path that I took to arrive at my conclusions so that academically the study is as transparent as possible. To date, I have not included any digital history tools in my studies, so my path has been one of the regular historian. I collect sources from an archive or library and use direct information to form conclusions about my research topic.
