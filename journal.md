Journal for week three 

What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do? Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date.

This week I dealt a lot with cleaning up data for proper analysis. In this process, I had to make seemingly small decisions about my data that would end up impacting my overall results. 
In general, I was successful in including all relevant information and only removing irrelevant data in both Sublime Text and OpenRefine. 


Digital historians have a valuable advantage over regular historians in regards to the methods that can be used to analyze information. The difference between the two lies in the technology that is used to gather and discern information. Regular historians largely rely on documents in archives, and in some cases oral histories etc. to represent their knowledge. Showing work as a regular history mainly boils down to presenting specficic evidence as it was explored in the archives. 

Digital historians are able to use tools that refine data to present evidence through a digital interface.
