Journal for week three 

What is the value of/for historians (regular historians) showing their work, as opposed to, or in contrast to, what digital historians have to do? Where is the scholarly value in showing your work - and contrast this with how youâ€™ve written history to date.

This week I dealt a lot with cleaning up data for proper analysis. In this process, I had to make seemingly small decisions about my data that would end up impacting my overall results. 
In general, I was successful in including all relevant information and only removing irrelevant data in both Sublime Text and OpenRefine. 


Digital historians have a valuable advantage over regular historians in regards to the methods that can be used to analyze information.
